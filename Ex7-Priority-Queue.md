# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE:
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2.Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3.Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4.Print each element of the array during the loop.
5.After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.
6.End  
## Program:
```

*/ 
void printArray(int array[], int size) 
{ 
int i; 
for(i=0;i<size;i++) 
{ 
printf("%d ",array[i]); 
} 
printf("\n"); 
}
